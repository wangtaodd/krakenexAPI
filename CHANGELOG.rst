[v2.0.0a1] - 2017-09-21 (Thursday)
----------------------------------

**Internal alpha testing release!**

Not for general use. For that reason, ``pip`` package not provided.

Changed (breaking!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **Everything network-related now handled by `requests`_.** (`#11`_)
* ``krakenex.API`` class no longer has a ``conn`` atrribute for
  connection manipulation. It has been replaced by a ``session``
  attribute, which is a ``requests.Session``.
* ``krakenex.API`` constructor no longer accepts ``conn`` argument
  as a means of re-using an existing ``krakenex.Connection`` object.

Removed
^^^^^^^
* ``krakenex.Connection`` class.
* ``krakenex.API.set_connection()`` method (deprecated in ``v1.0.0``).

[v1.0.0] - 2017-09-18 (Monday)
------------------------------

For a detailed list of changes, refer to the same-number releases below.

Changed (breaking!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* If you were previously calling ``API.query_private()`` or
  ``API.query_public()`` in a ``try/except`` block, be aware that
  these two may now throw ``http.client.HTTPException``, if the
  underlying ``Connection`` returns a non-`20x` status code. (`#17`_)

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^
* ``krakenex.API.set_connection()`` method. Access ``krakenex.API.conn``
  attribute directly.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^
* There is no straightforward way to reset the ``krakenex.API`` object's
  connection ``krakenex.API.conn``. (`#53_`)

The recommended workaround for now, assuming ``k = krakenex.API()``:

.. code-block:: sh

   k.conn.close()
   k.conn = None

If a connection is not closed prior to the reference being removed, the
connection will continue to linger, preventing removal of the object by
the garbage collector.

Changed (breaking!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  status code. This propagates all the way up, to
  ``API.query_{private,public}``. (`#17`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

  (as was described in the docs). (`#27`_)
* Be explicit when using default arguments in functions that have
  optional ones. (`#19`_)

Deprecated
